# Social Network API

## Description
This API would act as a database back end to a social media site like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. It would allow the storage of user data and allow users to connect in different ways.

Social media is quickly becoming one of the more unique ways people connect in a modern technological era. It is definitely important for aspiring developers to understand the function of the backend of such sites
